Welcome to the show, leave your problems at the door.
Come and sing along and get out on the floor.
This is what we wanted, this is what we need.
This is heart and soul it's just that easy to see.
I guess that dreams do come true, but we owe it all to you.
This is everything worth living for, blood sweat tears and so much more.
This is the only thing we'll ever know, so welcome to the show.
We're not getting younger, the days go by so fast.
We're running out of second chances so let's make this one last.
