(Ahh. Alright. Let's do this.)

Oh my friends don't care about everything
As long as you got a story to bring
We'll take you along
Take you along
Take you along to some other place
As we drive towards the other horizon
Maybe to spend a couple of hundred
Till' we run out
Till' we run out
Till' we run out of paper and change

So tell me if I'm starting to think so recklessly
I may just write a letter home
To say goodbye to everyone, and

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Welcome to the show, oh, oh, oh
Come and see the world in a different light
And capture it with our own eyes, and
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Take a risk and go, oh, oh, oh
I just hope that I remember this
Cause one day, it is something I will miss

Oh my friends think I'm a different kind
But there's nothing wrong with sharing my mind
To everyone else
Everyone else
Everyone else will think that it's weird
So maybe I might start keeping it clean
And bear with the whole unusual feeling
I'll be alright
Will be alright
Will be alright for two or three days

But after all the conversations have died out
I'll play the music from the beginning
And then we all just sing it again

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Welcome to the show, oh, oh, oh
Come and see the world in a different light
And capture it with our own eyes, and
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Take a risk and go, oh, oh, oh
I just hope that I remember this
Cause one day, it is something I will miss

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Welcome to the show, oh, oh, oh
Come and see the world in a different light
And capture it with our own eyes, and
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Take a risk and go, oh, oh, oh
I just hope that I remember this
Cause one day, it is something I will miss
